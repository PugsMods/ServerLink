Q: Messages from the 2 way chat feature repeats 2 times

A: Your config is probably outdated, please regenerate your config by deleting the config.yml found in plugins/ServerLink/config.yml and run the server. now the latest version of the config should be generated, now you may reconfigure SL.

A: Ping me(PugzAreCute#4636) in my [discord server](https://discord.gg/geNRqMu5XW) in the #general channel, I will help you in some time. Please note: Be patient, I am a human and I need to sleep. So I may take time to respond

# How to setup this plugin (Im too lazy to complete this so contact me in my discord)

### Hey, you should probably read this

## Step 1: Obtaining a bot token
First head to [Discord Developer Portal](https://discord.com/developers/applications) And log in/create a new account.

Then, Click on that big blue button in the top-right corner of your screen(Next to your profile picture). Refer to image 1.1 If you need help

Note: You probably won't have any applications

After that, enter a really cool name in the window that pops up. Refer to image 1.2 if you need help.

Note: It probably wont ask you for a team, if it asks you, select "Personal"

Then click the big blue button that says "Create"

Now in this screen copy the application id, we will need it later

Now click "Bot" on the list in the left-hand side of your screen. If you need help refer to image 1.3

Now, Change the profile picture and username to your liking.

Also, disable "Public Bot", as adding the bot in more than one server will break the plugin. If you need help refer to image 1.6

#### IMAGE 1.6

Note: Click on the slider underlined in image 1.6, it should be gray

After you are done, click on the "Copy" button below Token. If you need help please refer to image 1.7

Now the token should be copied in your clipboard

## NOTE: Do NOT Share your token with anyone

Keep the token aside for some time, we will use it later
